# MongoDB Connection Troubleshooting

## Issue: "MongoDB disconnected" message

If you're seeing "MongoDB disconnected" in the compiler, here are the common causes and fixes:

### 1. **Deprecated Options Removed**
✅ Fixed: Removed deprecated `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` options
- These were causing warnings and have been removed from the connection code

### 2. **Check MongoDB Atlas Connection**

**Common Issues:**

#### IP Address Not Whitelisted
- Go to MongoDB Atlas → Network Access
- Add your IP address (or 0.0.0.0/0 for development)
- Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to take effect

#### Wrong Credentials
- Verify username and password in `.env` file
- Check MongoDB Atlas → Database Access

#### Cluster Not Running
- Go to MongoDB Atlas → Database
- Ensure your cluster is running (not paused)

### 3. **Connection String Format**

Make sure your `.env` file has:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/face-entry-guard?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

### 4. **Restart Server After Changes**

After updating `.env` or fixing connection issues:
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 5. **Check Connection Status**

When server starts, you should see:
```
✅ Connected to MongoDB Atlas
📊 Database: face-entry-guard
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
🚀 Server is running on http://localhost:5000
```

If you see "MongoDB disconnected", check:
- MongoDB Atlas cluster status
- Network Access settings
- Connection string credentials
- Internet connectivity

### 6. **Test Connection**

You can test the MongoDB connection by:
1. Registering a user through the frontend
2. Check MongoDB Atlas → Browse Collections → `users` collection
3. If data appears, connection is working!

## Fixed Issues

✅ Removed deprecated MongoDB driver options
✅ Added better connection status logging
✅ Improved error messages
